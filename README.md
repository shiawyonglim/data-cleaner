Cyber Intrusion Detection and Classification using R
An in-depth analysis of the UNSW-NB15 dataset to identify the key characteristics of various cyber-attacks. This project uses R and the Tidyverse ecosystem to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, predictive modeling, and provides an interactive console for on-demand data exploration.

Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of network traffic data to differentiate normal activity from 9 distinct types of cyber-attacks. The workflow is divided into two main scripts:

data_preparation.R: Handles all data cleaning, pre-processing, and transformation tasks to prepare the raw data for analysis.

visualize.R: The main analysis engine. It performs all statistical analyses, generates visualizations, builds a predictive model, and contains the final interactive data explorer.

The ultimate goal is to turn raw network data into meaningful, actionable insights for decision-making in the cybersecurity domain.

Key Features
7 In-Depth Analysis Objectives: Goes beyond simple descriptions to include comparative, relational, predictive, and inferential statistical analyses.

Predictive Modeling: Implements a logistic regression model to identify the most significant network features for detecting an attack.

Statistical Hypothesis Testing: Uses ANOVA to statistically validate findings and draw robust conclusions.

Advanced Visualizations: Creates a variety of plots including a correlation heatmap, faceted charts, density plots, and more to uncover hidden patterns.

Fully Interactive Console: Features a powerful, menu-driven interactive explorer that allows a user to ask questions, generate plots, view model results, and export data on-demand.

File Structure
To run this project, ensure the following files are all located in the same root directory:

/your-project-folder
|-- data_preparation.R
|-- visualize.R
|-- UNSW-NB15_uncleaned.csv
|-- 6. NUSW-NB15_features (data description).csv
|-- README.md

A result/ folder will be created automatically to store all generated output.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
R and RStudio: You must have a recent version of R and RStudio installed.

Installation & Usage
The project is designed to be self-contained and easy to run.

Open the Project: Open the visualize.R file in RStudio. This is the main script you will execute.

Run the Script: Run the entire script by clicking the "Source" button in RStudio or by using the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Enter. The script will automatically:

Install any required R packages (tidyverse, corrplot, broom).

Run the data_preparation.R script if the cleaned data file is missing.

Execute all 7 analysis objectives and save the output to the result/ folder.

Launch the Interactive Explorer: After the script finishes, type the following command directly into the R console and press Enter to start the interactive session:

ask_the_data()

You will be greeted with a menu of 10 options to explore the data and analysis results. Type exit to quit.

Showcase of Results
Below are some of the key visualizations generated by the analysis, providing insights into the dataset.

Attack Distribution
An initial overview showing the frequency of each attack category in the dataset. "Generic" and "Exploits" are the most common attack types.

Connection State Analysis
This faceted chart reveals the unique "fingerprints" of different attacks. Note the high prevalence of INT (Interrupted) states for "Reconnaissance" attacks, a strong indicator of scanning activity.

Correlation Heatmap
This heatmap provides a high-level view of relationships between all numerical features. The strong positive correlation (dark blue) between sbytes and spkts (source bytes and source packets) is logical, while other correlations can inspire deeper investigation.

Predictive Model Coefficients
This plot visualizes the output of the logistic regression model, making it easy to see which features are the most important predictors of an attack. Features marked "Significant" have a statistically proven impact.

Generated Output Files
The visualize.R script generates the following files in the result/ folder:

Plots
attack_distribution.png: Bar chart showing the frequency of each attack category.

duration_by_attack_category.png: Box plot comparing connection durations across attack types.

correlation_heatmap.png: Heatmap visualizing the relationships between all numerical features.

sbytes_vs_sloss_by_attack.png: Scatter plot showing the relationship between data volume and packet loss.

state_distribution_by_attack.png: Faceted bar chart comparing connection states for each attack.

rate_density_normal_vs_exploits.png: Density plot comparing connection rates for Normal vs. Exploits traffic.

breakdown_*.png: On-demand plots generated by the interactive explorer.

model_coefficients.png: Bar chart visualizing the importance of predictors from the logistic regression model.

Data Files
prediction_results.csv: Contains the input data for the model plus its final predictions (probability and label).

anova_result.csv: A tidy table containing the full statistical output of the ANOVA test.

User-Exported Files: Any CSV files generated on-demand using option 10 in the interactive explorer.
